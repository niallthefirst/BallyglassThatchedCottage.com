Quiet, comfort, what more could you possibly want or expect from a country cottage holiday in beautiful Ireland...??? Outstanding!!! 5*"

29th Jun 2019,"Comment: We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ballyglass Cottage, it was our second time to stay here and we can't wait to return again. This cottage is a very serene home away from home. Our children absolutely adore everything about Ballyglass Cottage. If you want a relaxing break while also being within driving distance to many wonderful places to visit, particularly in the Midlands and the West of Ireland then I recommend you book this fantastic cottage to get away from it all. The best thing being that there is very little signal inside the cottage so you even get a break from the internet, 100% recommend."
8th Jun 2019,"Comment: great location, warm comfortable accommodation. After busy urban living the tranquil environment a total chill out experience"

4th Aug 2018,Comment: Lovely peaceful place relaxing all the way . Deffo go back again.
14th Jul 2018,Comment: We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ballyglass Cottage. We didn't want to leave. Everything was as described there were no nasty surprises. We would like to make a return trip and possibly make it an annual tradition for our family as we absolutely loved every minute of our stay here.
7th Jul 2018,"Comment: The Cottage is located in a very quite and peaceful area, real sense of safety about it. Wonderful grounds outside for kids to play in - and again feel so safe and secure leaving them about outside also. Plenty to do in area - depending on what you want from walks, bikes in shed ( 6) to go cycling. Rosscommon town only 20 minutes away as is Athlone town- would highly recommend the cottage and area!"
27th May 2018,Comment: The most relaxing and wonderful stay.Made many great day trips and got to return home to peace and quiet. Loved it.
17th Mar 2018,"Comment: It was perfect. One thing that may help is having WiFi. Thank you very much, it was an excellent getaway"
18th Feb 2018,Comment: Sykes advertised a cottage which I booked however a short time after I was informed the cottage was no longer available. I received my deposit money back however had little help or assistance in finding a replacement cottage from Sykes or any compensation for having to madly look for another cottage. I realise it was the owners who retracted the dates however surely there should be an agreement that dates that are on the website and booked stay booked and cannot be cancelled by the owner at the drop of a hat.
9th Sep 2017,"Comment: No,accommodation excellent. Many thanks"

24th Jun 2017,Comment: This is a lovely cottage in a great location and we have stayed in it twice before. The cottage is set in a quiet and beautiful area but it is very accessible for Athlone (motorway connection as well) and Roscommon. The owners are very nice people and it has been a pleasure to stay in their family's cottage. I am also rather biased as my mother comes from this part of Ireland.

19th Mar 2016,"Great homely feel to the cottage. On arrival it was clear the owner took a great deal of pride in the presentation, as it was very clean and had all the amenities as described prior to arrival. Garden was great for our dog to stretch his legs first thing in the morning and both outbuildings contained all you need for a week away (washing machine and waste disposal facilities). I will certainly be coming back and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean and homely cottage with that personal touch."
12th Sep 2015,Excellent will return and use again perfect for pets walking the land garden is great too.
29th Aug 2015,very friendly owner

6th Jun 2015,The cottage is in a beautiful position and is very convenient for Roscommon town and for Athlone. The surrounding area is very quiet and peaceful.
23rd May 2015,Situated in a quiet location. But within easy reach of towns
16th May 2015,"The cottage was perfect for our get away to find our family roots in the beautiful country side of Ireland. It was like taking a step back in time, while still having all the creature comforts at your disposal! Niall and his family did a beautiful job with the restoration. It was an amazing find for us1 Thank You Trip Advisor =) . Recessed lighting, access to the loft bedrooms via either a spiral staircase or a ladder, bedroom down, full working kitchen. We were giving a print out to bring along with 40 pages worth of information and a number to call just in case they left something out. You are made to feel welcome in their home and it makes you want to return. There are 40 acres to explore and all they ask is that you close the gates behind you as you enter. So whether you live in the busy cities in Ireland and just want a quiet retreat or you want a great away from another country in the country...This is perfect."
28th Mar 2015,What a perfect place to stay. Our four daughters loved sleeping up in the lofts. It was true country living. We all loved watching all the sheep across the road. We made a lot of day trips under two hours and visited several castles and tourist attractions. The owner was delightful to talk to. Ireland was absolutely gorgeous. Our favorite place in Ireland was in Roscommon. We loved hiking through sheep pastures at RinDoon. It is a ruined church and medieval city walking area. We would definitely recommend this rental to others. It was very affordable and we made very special memories as a family.
21st Mar 2015,"Loved that it was represented exactly as shown in the pictures and as described! There were little &quot;quirky&quot; things that made us feel truly in the country in a beautifully restored-but-old cottage! Once you learn how to turn everything on, everything works beautifully, and we love the conservation that they expect (because we are &quot;green&quot; people). Niall couldn't have been friendlier, and Ray was an absolute DELIGHT to meet and talk to. Great location for us! Day trips within easy reach, the cottage serene and so peaceful. Would definitely do it again!"

17th May 2014,Good Comments: A dream location hidden in beautiful countryside. The cottage itself is idyllic and just a short drive from the lovely little town of Roscommon and also from Athlone which has many attractions. Nearby is the Hodson Bay - worth a look and a walk around the lake. The cottage was perfect and would absolutely go here again!

3rd Aug 2013,Good Comments: The peaceful location of the cottage was ideal for a weeks break away from it all and was thoroughly enjoyable and touring Ireland was fab
22nd Jun 2013,"Good Comments: peaceful and relaxing. Set in the middle of the countryside on a typical Irish minor road, ( one car width with passing places - farm gates, property entrances). Whilst the cottage was on the owners land and surrounded by their farm, you never saw them. But they were only a phone call away if you needed them."
15th Jun 2013,Good Comments: I could not have imagined a more beautiful place to stay in Ireland. 100% perfect!
